# Commands

### Staging changes using "git add ."

Using a dot here will result in every change you made to be forwarded. Alternatively, you can also stage single files individually by using the corresponding paths.

```
git add .
```
### Commiting changes using "git commit"
```
git commit "changes"
```

### Push your changes to the hub using "git push"
```
git push
```

### Pull changes from the hub using "git pull"

You're probably not the only one to make changes in the repository.
Using pull will sync your repos with changes pushed to the hub by other people.

```
git pull
```
